# game-react-training

This is a project that connect to an API to create and play a game.

Preview available on [http://monster-game-react.herokuapp.com/](https://monster-game-react.herokuapp.com/). Make sure to open the http version of the site and not the https one, otherwise there will be a mixed content error since the API endpoint for the backend runs over http.
